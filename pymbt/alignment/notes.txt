overall goal:
    Supply function with reference sequence and sequencing results, get back:
        1. Alignment (FASTA ando otherwise) (for possible re-evaluation)
        2. Report function / printout
        3. Graphical output - at least something comparable to R version 

Additional function:
    1. Read in ab1 files, allow list of ab1 objects as results argument
    2. When ab1 files used, option to view discrepancies w/ traces, make executive decision - interactive UI workflow

So, current ideal manual workflow:
    1. ref = Read in reference sequence (genbank/ape format)
    2. res = Read in results (ab1 files)
    3. aligned = sanger_align(ref,res)
    4. aligned.report() = print summary
    5. aligned.write(path,format)
    6. aligned.plot() = visualization
    7. aligned.writeplot(path,format)
    8. aligned.mismatches()[0] - lists mismatches, e.g. the first
    9. aligned.fixmismatch(0,'A') - sets first mismatch to be an 'A'.

Ideal automaed workflow: have a bunch of results and a bunch of references,
want reports written out fast and in batch fashion. But still need some level of interaction
sometimes....

    1. list of refs, list of results dirs, let it go to town.
    2. In terms of feedback, has to be manual until we can make the basecaller better.
