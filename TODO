Unit tests
Sequence repeat detector - fuzzy matching / alignments 
Alignment module - batch processing of Sanger sequencing files
Use Biopython Seq and SeqRecord objects for all sequences? 
    Pros: Don't need to reinvent the wheel - alphabet checking, rev comp, etc 
    Cons: Using Seq objects can be a pain for users (and me)
