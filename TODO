Create unit tests
Put multiprocessing progress helper in a class / function for reuse, clean code
Make cytometry module - no more R reliance
Decide whether there should or should not be a Biopython dependency
    Pros: automatically handle alphabet checking, reverse complementations, etc
    Cons: another dependency to package, somewhat obfuscated API for sequence (Seq objects)
Plotting module - make plotting the data we generate easier
In Progress: Alignment module - batch processing of Sanger sequencing files
    Will probably put in a web frontend, so separate out backend and frontend stuff
