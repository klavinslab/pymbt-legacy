Sequence repeat detector - fuzzy matching / alignments 
    integrate into OrthoSeq
Store sequences as objects - similar to Biopython Seq but geared towards
simplicity and extensibility
Nupack:
    Check cloning primers for self-self, pair structure using Nupack
        Part of Primers object
    Gibson object:
        Should check whether the desired overlap is a high-probability structure
