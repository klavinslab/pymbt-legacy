Sequence repeat detector - fuzzy matching / alignments 
    integrate into OrthoSeq
DNA object model, design object model, reaction simulation object model,
analysis object model
Nupack / RNA folding:
    Check cloning primers for self-self, pair structure using Nupack
        Part of Primers object
    Gibson object:
        Should check whether the desired overlap is a high-probability structure
    Replace / add optional RNAFold or equivalent function. Nupack is
    proprietary
Drop emboss dependency by using pycogent / pycogent approach for needleman-wunsch
